# 遇到的问题

Navigator operation requested with a context that does not include a Navigator.

使用的 Context 没有一个以 Navigator 作为父级。

```dart
Navigator.push(context,
                        new MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) {
                      return new Chapter4HomePage();
                    }));
```

```
The following assertion was thrown while handling a gesture:
Navigator operation requested with a context that does not include a Navigator.

The context used to push or pop routes from the Navigator must be that of a widget that is a descendant of a Navigator widget.
When the exception was thrown, this was the stack: 
#0      Navigator.of.<anonymous closure> (package:flutter/src/widgets/navigator.dart:2607:9)
#1      Navigator.of (package:flutter/src/widgets/navigator.dart:2614:6)
#2      Navigator.push (package:flutter/src/widgets/navigator.dart:2072:22)
#3      FlutterInActionMain.build.<anonymous closure> (package:flutter_app/flutter_in_action/main.dart:41:31)

#7      BaseTapGestureRecognizer._checkUp (package:flutter/src/gestures/tap.dart:306:5)
```
